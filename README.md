# 🛣 Road Scene Segmentation for Autonomous Driving

This project is a smart AI tool that *automatically identifies different objects and elements on the road, such as vehicles, pedestrians, lanes, potholes, sidewalks, traffic signs, and more. It can work with images and even in **real time using your webcam**, making it suitable for **self-driving car research**, **smart city applications**, and **road safety monitoring**.

---

## What This Project Does

- It uses *AI to understand road scenes* from camera input.
- It was trained on *real driving data from Indian roads* and *pothole images*.
- It works in real-time with a *webcam* or with *uploaded road images*.
- It shows you different parts of the road in *colored labels* so you can understand what the AI sees.

---

## Behind the Scenes

This project uses:
- A *DeepLabV3 semantic segmentation model*
- Trained on *IDD (India Driving Dataset)* + *Roboflow pothole dataset*
- Supports 28 classes: 27 from IDD, 1 pothole
- Written in *Python* using *PyTorch* and *Streamlit* for the UI

---

## Features

- Recognizes and segments road, lanes, vehicles, buildings, sky, people, potholes, etc.
- Works with uploaded images
- Works live with a webcam stream
- Displays *color-coded masks* with a *legend* for 28 classes
- Easy to use – no coding knowledge required to run the app

## How to Use (Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Install Everything

#### Option A: Easy way (recommended for beginners)
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # For Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate       # For Linux/macOS

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Download the Datasets

#### IDD Dataset (Manual Step)
- Go to: https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/
- Download: *IDD Segmentation Part I*
- Extract it inside data/idd_segmentation/

#### Roboflow Pothole Dataset (Automatic)
Already integrated into the app using Roboflow API:
```python
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
project = rf.workspace("jay-ngdms").project("pothole-detection-system-rnoh4-xjw6w")
version = project.version(1)
version.download("coco-segmentation")
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Dataset
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### Step 4: Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Two App Modes

### 📸 Image Segmentation Mode
- Upload a photo of a road
- AI will highlight roads, cars, people, sky, potholes, etc.
- Colored result + class legend displayed

### Real-Time Segmentation Mode
- Turn on your webcam
- AI will segment and label objects *live*
- Helps simulate how self-driving cars "see" the road

## Class Legend (28 Classes)

The app shows a *legend* (key) for each class and its color.
| ID | Class Name     |
|----|----------------|
| 0  | Road           |
| 1  | Sidewalk       |
| 2  | Building       |
| 3  | Wall           |
| 4  | Fence          |
| 5  | Pole           |
| 6  | Traffic Light  |
| 7  | Traffic Sign   |
| 8  | Vegetation     |
| 9  | Terrain        |
| 10 | Sky            |
| 11 | Person         |
| 12 | Rider          |
| 13 | Car            |
| 14 | Truck          |
| 15 | Bus            |
| 16 | Train          |
| 17 | Motorcycle     |
| 18 | Bicycle        |
| 19 | Lane Marking   |
| 20 | Parking Area   |
| 21 | Animal         |
| 22 | Debris         |
| 23 | Manhole        |
| 24 | Water Body     |
| 25 | Billboard      |
| 26 | Bridge         |
| 27 | Pothole        |

Each is color-coded using *visually distinct and non-similar colors* for clarity.

## How the Model Works

- Based on *DeepLabV3 with ResNet-50*
- Re-trained with custom final layer: 28 output channels
- Trained from scratch on merged dataset using PyTorch
- Works on CPU or GPU

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- *Autonomous Driving*: Self-driving car perception module.
- *Smart Road Monitoring*: Detect potholes, sidewalk damage, crowding.
- *AI Education*: Learn segmentation models hands-on.
- *Urban Planning*: Visualize how cities can better design roads.
- *Traffic Analytics*: Understand road usage in different conditions.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add instance-level segmentation (detect each car/person separately)
- Add mouse-click label display on segmented images
- Video file input for recorded dashcam footage
- Train for weather generalization (rain, fog, night)
- Convert to mobile app with TensorFlow Lite or ONNX
